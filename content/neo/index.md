eNeo supports model management as a layer over Neo4j, a fairly well-known graph database.
eNeo uses eMSL (the eMoflon Specification Language), a uniform modelling language for metamodelling and modelling, specifying patterns, graph constraints, rules, and triple graph grammars, all in the same uniform textual syntax with advanced support for modularity and reuse via refinement.
eNeo provides an export of models (with all referenced metamodels) to Neo4j, as well as an export of patterns, constraints, rules, and triple rules to Cypher, the query and transformation language used by Neo4j.
eNeo also supports an API to automate all these tasks programmatically.
