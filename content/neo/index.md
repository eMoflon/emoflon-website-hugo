**eNeo** supports model management as a layer over Neo4j, a fairly well-known graph database.
**eNeo** uses eMSL (the eMoflon Specification Language), a uniform modeling language for metamodeling and modeling, specifying patterns, graph constraints, rules, and triple graph grammars, all in the same uniform textual syntax with advanced support for modularity and reuse via refinement.
**eNeo** provides an export of models (with all referenced metamodels) to Neo4j, as well as an export of patterns, constraints, rules, and triple rules to Cypher, the query and transformation language used by Neo4j.
**eNeo** also supports an API to automate all these tasks programmatically.

**eMoflon::Neo** is licensed open source under EPL 1.0.
Its source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon-neo).
