There are two ways to download eMoflon::IBeX.
We recommend the usage of our [pre-built Eclipse application](#pre-built-eclipse-application).

## Pre-built Eclipse Application

You can download the latest version of our pre-built Eclipse application from the [release section of our GitHub repository](https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon-eclipse-build/releases).

There are several versions available for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**:

- **Eclipse eMoflon user**: Version with pre-installed eMoflon::IBeX as plug-in. You can use this version to develop your own applications/tools that use eMoflon::IBeX.
- **Eclipse eMoflon dev**: Version without pre-installed eMoflon::IBeX. This one can be used to develop eMoflon::IBeX itself.

## Eclipse Update Site

You can use our [Eclipse update site](https://emoflon.org/emoflon-ibex-updatesite/snapshot/updatesite/) to install eMoflon::IBeX as plug-in: [https://emoflon.org/emoflon-ibex-updatesite/snapshot/updatesite/](https://emoflon.org/emoflon-ibex-updatesite/snapshot/updatesite/)

- Keep in mind that you have to use the Eclipse Modeling tools with a few plug-ins. Please check out the installation instructions in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon-ibex#how-to-develop).
