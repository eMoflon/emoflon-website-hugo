### Pre-built Virtual Machine (IBeX VM)

You can download the latest version of our pre-built virtual machine image from the [release section of our GitHub repository](https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon-ibex-vm/releases).

Unfortunately, we aren't able to release the whole OVA image as one file on GitHub. Therefore, you have to download all ZIP archive parts and extract them locally on your computer.
