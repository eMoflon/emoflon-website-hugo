<!-- Copy-pasted from the old eMoflon webpage -->
eMoflon::IBeX is an incremental interpreter for graph patterns and graph transformation rules (for unidirectional model transformation), and for Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) for bidirectional model transformation.
eMoflon::IBeX uses an incremental graph pattern matcher meaning that it can be used for reactive programming and trades memory for almost constant response time to model changes.
eMoflon::IBeX was designed with flexibility in mind and already offers many more model management operations than has ever been possible in the same TGG tool.
Some of the tasks we already support and can be automatically derived from a single TGG include:
model generation, consistency checking, link creation, and incremental model synchronisation.
